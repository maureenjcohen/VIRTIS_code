Function V_GetPath, filename, fname

;+
; NAME:
;	V_ GetPath
;
; PURPOSE:
;	Extract directory and filename from a string
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;	Dirname = V_GetPath(filename, Fname)
;
; INPUTS:
;          Filename = full path to the file to be read
;
; OUTPUTS:
;	result = Directory name + final separator ("dir/" under Unix)
;               Empty if not present in input string
;           Fname = File name alone in output
;
; COMMENT:
;          This function works in IDL ≥ 5.4, VMS not supported
;          A simpler way exists in IDL 6.0, do used for support of older versions
;
; EXAMPLES:
;          DirName = v_getpath(filename, Fname)
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;	Written: Stephane Erard, LESIA, LESIA 2007
;	Fix for Windows paths on IDL 6.2, SE, 23/2/2007
